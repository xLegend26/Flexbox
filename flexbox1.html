        /*This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much available space along the main axis each flex item will take up compared to other flex items. 
        In this case, we're giving each <article> element the same value (a value of 1), which means they'll all take up an equal amount of the spare space left after properties like padding and margin have been set. 
        This value is proportionally shared among the flex items: giving each flex item a value of 400000 would have exactly the same effect.*/

        /*This basically states, "Each flex item will first be given 200px of the available space. After that, the rest of the available space will be shared according to the proportion units." 
        Try refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared.*/

        The first two flex items have one unit each, so they each take 1/4 of the available space. The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).*/
